# Unofficial Linux client for the Blokada-VPN-service

	This is a shellscript that let's you set up wireguard to connect to Blokada's VPN-service.
	It's not an official Linux client!
	This script is only tested on Kali Linux and partialy on Ubuntu but should work on most Linux systems.
	Be sure to check if wireguard is running and your IP changed to the one of the selected gateway after exectuting the script.
	If you find problems caused by using a different distribution, please describe in the issue how it would work in your distribution.
